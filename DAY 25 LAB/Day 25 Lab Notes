COMMAND'S :

	- sh ip protocol
	- default gateway command : ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2
									\
								         ---> Review
									/
	- default-information originate
	
	Loopback Interface :
		- interface loopback <number>

	RIP Command :
		- router rip
		- version <number>
		- network <ip address >
	
	Passive int Command :
		- passive-interface <int>

Notes :
	
	- Passive interface command tell the router to stop sending rip advertisement out of 			that port

	- Loopback interfaces are used for
		+ Management, 
		+ Routing protocols 
		+ Testing
	
		--> the interface is always on <--

	- RIP : Routing Information Protocol
		
		-> Distance Vector IGP
			+ Routing by Rumor Logic to Learn/Share routes			

		-> Uses hop count as a metric
			+ One router is a hop
			+ Maximum hop count is 15

		-> Has three Versions :

			RIPv1 
				\
				 ---> used for IPv4
				/
			RIPv2	

			---> RIPv1 Breakdown :
				
				1. Only advertises classfull address (Class A, Class B, Class C)
				
				2. No subnetting 
			
				3. No subnet mask info in response message
					ex:
						10.1.1.0/24 --> 10.0.0.0

			---> RIPv2 Breakdown :
	
				1. support everything RIPv1 doesnt	
				
				2. messages are multicast to 224.0.0.9
				
					- Multicast: messages are delivered only to devices that 
						have joined that specific multicast group
					
				  	- Broadcast : message delivered to all devices on the 							local network	
	

			RIPng (RIP Next Generation), used for IPv6

		-> RIP have 2 message types
			
			Request : ask for neighbors routing table

			Response : give routing table to neighbor
		
				*** RIP routers share data every 30 second ***

		--> Rip 'network' command is classfull, it will automatically convert to 				classfull networks

			ex: 
				10.0.55.2 will become 10.0.0.0 ( class A)

		+ Network command tell router which interface active RIP on, not which network 				to advertise

COMMENDS :

	- router ospf <1-65535> Process ID

		# Proccess ID

		   * locally significant

		   * router with different ID's can become OSPF Neighbors
	
	- network <network address> <wildcard> area <#>
	
		   * network command requires you to specify the area	

	- passive-interface <interface>

	- Default route : ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2
	
	- advertise default route into OSPF : default-information originate
	
	- sh ip ospf neighbor
	


OSPF :
	- Use's Dijkstra's algorithm  to find the shortest path to the destination router

	- Three Versions 
		* OSPFv1 (1989) ---> not in use anymore
		* OSPFv2 (1998) ---> used for IPv4
		* OSPFv3 (2008) ---> Used for IPv6 mainly, but also support IPv4

	-  Routers store information about the network in LSA, then LSA are organized in a LSDB
		
		* LSA ---> Link State Advertisement

		* LSDB ---> Link State Database
	
		---> Routers then floods LSA's until all routers in the OSPF area develop the 			     same map of the network

	- LSA Flooding :
		* Every LSA has an aging timer of 30 min by default, then the LSA will be 			  flooded again

	- OSPF STEPS :
	
		1. Become neighbors
			# connected to the same segment

		2. Exchange LSA
			# with neighbor routers

		3. Calculate the best routes to each destination
			# this information is inserted into the routing table

	- Area's :

		# OSPF uses areas to divide up the network

			- Small networks can be in a single-area 

				# no negative effect's on the network

			- Single-area design have negative effects in large networks
	
				# SPF Algorithm takes more time to calculate routes
				
				# SPF Algorithm takes more time to calculate routes
		
				# SPF require more proccessing power on the routers
				
				# LSDB takes up more memory on the routers
				 
				# Any change in the network causes every router to react

		# An area is a set of routers and links that share the same LSDB
			
		   - BACKBONE AREA (area 0) ---> is an area that all other areas must connect to

		   - Internal Routers ---> routers with all int in the same area

		   - Area Border Routers (ABRs) ---> routers with int in multiple area's

			* ABR's maintain a separate LSDB for each area they are connected to

				---> ABR's should only be connect to 2 areas maximum

		   - Backbone Routers ---> routers connected to the backbone area (area 0)

		   - Intra-Area Route ---> a route to a destination inside the same OSPF area

		   - Interarea Route ---> a route to destination in a different OSPF area

		   - All OSPF area's have atleast one ABR connected to the backbone area
			
		   - OSPF interfaces in the same subnet must be in the same area

	- Autonomous System Boundary Router (ASBR) :
	
		  # OSPF router that connects the OSPF network to an external network

			EX: use the default-information originate command to ASBR

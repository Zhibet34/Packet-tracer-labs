Dynamic Routing :  Routers use dynamic protocols to advertise information about the routes they know about other routers
	
	- If multiple routes to a destination are learned, the router determines which route is superior and adds it to 		the routing table	
	
		+ Metrics are used to determine which route is superior
			-> lower metric = superior
	
	- Dynamic Routing Protocol Categories :
		
		IGP : Interior Gateway Protocol
			-> used to share routes within a single autonomous system, single company
				ex:
					 R --> Router
				       /   \                } --> Local | One company
			  Router  <--  R    R --> Router
			
			 + Algorithm types :
		
				- Distance Vector : operate by sending the following to its connected 						neighbors 
					---> Advertise its information to its neighbors <---					

					+ the following are :
						--> Knowned destination networks          \
											   --->  Routing By Rumor 
						--> Metric to reach thier known networks  /
					--> Router only Learn 
						- 'Distance' (metric) 
						- 'Vector' (direction, the next-hop router) of each route
													  <--
					* older than Link State Protocol
					* early examples :
						--> RIPv1
						--> IGRP : older version of EIGRP 					

					Types :
						--> RIP - Routing Information Protocol
						--> EIGRP - Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
				
				- Link State : every router creates a 'connectivity map' of the network

					---> Map the network by gathering information from the routers <---
					
					- Each router advertise information about its interfaces to its neighbors, until 					  	all routers in the network develop the same map of the network
						
						+ Each Router independently uses this map to calculate the best routes to 							each destination
						+ This Protocol use more resources (CPU) on the router, because more 
							infromation is shared
						+ Faster than Distance Vector Protocol
					
					Types :
						--> OSPF - Open Shortest Path First
						--> IS-IS - Intermediate System to Intermediate System
		
		EGP : Exterior Gateway Protocol
			-> used to share routes between different Companies
				ex: 
					R --> Router                       R   --> Router
				      /	  \              ----->          /   \
			  Router <-- R     R --> Router     Router <--  R     R    --> Router
			
				    COMPANY # 1                         COMPANY # 2

			   + Algorithm :
				
				 - Path Vector
					--> BGP - Border Gateway Protocol

      -	Dynamic Routing Protocol Metrics :
		
		* if a router using Dynamic Routing Protocol learns two different routes to the same destination :
			
			- It uses the metric value of the routes to determine which is best 
				+ lower metric = better
				     - each routing protocol uses a different metric to determine which route is the best

			- If a router learns two or more routes via the same routing protocol to the same destination         		             with the same metric, both will be added to the routing table

			- ECMP --> Equal Cost Multi-Path

			IGP               Metric                           Explanation
			
			RIP               Hop count                        Each router in the path counts as one 'hop' 
		
			EIGRP             Metric based on bandwidth        Complex formula that can take into account 						  & delay (by default)		   many values. by default, the bandwidth of the 									   slowest link in the route and the total delay 									   of all links in the route used   

			OSPF              Cost                             The cost of each link is calculated based on   									   bandwidth
		
			IS-IS             Cost                             The Total metric is the total cost of each
                                                                           link in the route

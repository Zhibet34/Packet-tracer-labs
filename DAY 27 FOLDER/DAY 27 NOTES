	# show ip ospf int <INT> 

	# 3 ways to modify ospf cost 

		- Change the reference bandwidth
			
			* auto-cost reference-bandwidth <# in megabits-per-second>

		- Manual configuration 
		
			* ip ospf cost < cost >

		- Change the interface bandwidth
		
			* bandwidth < kilobits-per-second >

	# sh ip ospf interface brief

	# activate OSPF directly on an interface
	
		- ip ospf <proccess-id> area <area-id>
	
		- passive-interface default

	# OSPF Neighbor

		- sh ip ospf neighbor

	# Display the OSPF INT Brief Description

		- sh ip ospf int brief


OSPF Metric (Cost) :

	# Automatically calculated based on the bandwidth (speed) of the interface
		
	        - Calculated by dividing a reference bandwidth value by the interface bandwidth
		
		     ---> Default Bandwidth is 100 mbps

		       + Ex :
			      * reference : 100 mbps / interface : 10 mbps --> cost of 10

			      * reference : 100 mbs / interface : 100 mbps --> cost of 1
	
			      * reference : 100 mbps / interface : 1000 mbps --> cost of 1

			      * reference : 100 mbps / interface : 10000 mbps --> cost of 1


				---> All values less than 1 will be converted to 1
	
				     - FastEthernet        \
				     - GigabitEthernet      ---> All equal | Default cost Of 1	
				     - 10GigEthernet	   /	    
							  	
		  - Reference bandwidth should be greater than the fastest link in the network

		  - Reference Bandwidth should be the same on all ospf routers on the network

		  - OSPF cost is  the total of the outgoing/exit interfaces

OSPF Neighbors :

	# Router's who becomes neighbors, automatically share network information and calculates 	  routes 
		
	      - when an interface is OSPF enabled the router starts sending OSPF hello 			
	
	      messages out of the interface at regular interval (determined by the hello timer).
		
			* The messages then are used to introduce the router to potential OSPF 
		
			  neighbors
			
			* Default Hello Timer is 10 seconds on ethernet connection


			* OSPF messages are encapsulated in an IP header, with a value of 89 in 			
	
			  the protocol field

			* Hello messages are Multicast to 224.0.0.5 ( OSPF Multicast Address)


	# Neighbor States

		1. Down State 

		    * The interface doesnt know about any OSPF neighbors yet

		2. Init State

		    * Hello packet received, but own router ID is not in the Hello Packet


		3. 2-Way State
	
		    * R2 send a hello packet containing the Router-ID of both routers to R1

			--> R1 will insert R2 into its OSPF neighbor table in the 2 way state
		
		    * R1 send another Hello message,  this time containing R2's Router ID
		
			--> Now both router are in the 2 way state

		    * 2 way state means the router has receive a hello packet with its own Router ID in it

		        --> Two way state means that all condition have been met for routers to become OSPF 

			    Neighbors ( Router's are ready to share LSA's )

			--> DR (Designated Router) And BDR (Backuo Designated Router) will be elected at this point

		4. Exstart State

		    * Router's will choose which router will start the exchange information about their LSDB   

			- The Router with the  Higher ID become the MASTER and start the exchange

			- The Router with the lowest ID become the SLAVE

		5. Exchange 
			
			- Routers exchange DBD's which contain a list of the LSA's int their LSDB
			
				--> DBD : Database Descriptor Packet
			
		6. Loading State

  		    * Router send Link State Request messages to request that their neighbors send them any LSA's 
		
		      they dont have 

			- LSA are sent in Link State Update messages

			- Routers send LSAck messgaes to acknowledge that they received the LSA's

		7. Full State 

		    * router have a full OSPF adjacency and identical LSDB's

			- Router continue to send and listen for hello packet (every 10 seconds) to maintain 
		
			  neighbors adjacency

			- Every hello packet is received , the 'Dead' timer ( 40 seconds by default ) is reset

			- Dead timer reach 0 and no Hello message is received, the neighbor is removed

			- Routers will continue to share LSA as the network changes to make sure each router has a

			  a complete and accurate map of the network (LSDB)

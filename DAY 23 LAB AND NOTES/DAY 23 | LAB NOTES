COMMEND'S :

	+ sh etherchannel load-balance
		+ Display the input's used in the interface selection calculation
			* Input examples
				- Source Mac
				- Des Mac
				- Source IP
				- Destination IP
				
	+ port-channel load-balance method
		+ This command is used to configure the method used in the interface calculation
			* Method's
				- dst-ip
				- dst-mac
				- src-dst-ip
				- src-dst-mac
				- src-ip 
				- src-mac
	
	+ channel-group <number> mode <mode>
		<number> : locally significant identifier for the etherchannel
		<mode> : how the etherchannel will negotiate with devices on the other end of 				the link
		mode types :
			active -> Enable LACP unconditionally
			auto -> Enable PAgP only if a PAgP device is detected
		 	desirable -> Enable PAgP unconditionally
			on -> Enable Etherchannel only
			passive -> Enable LACP only if LACP device is detected
		Example's :
			PAgp : channel-group 1 mode desirable
			LACP : channel-group 2 mode active
			static : channel-group 3 mode on
				static notes :
					-> on only work with on mode

	+ etherchannel summary
		-> will display a list of flag's and the number of channel's used with its 			corresponding flag
		Flags:
			P - Bundled in port-channel
			D - Down
			U - In use 		
			S - Layer2
			N - Not in use
			f - Failed to allocate aggregator
			R - Layer3
			s - Suspended
			A - Formed by auto LAG

ETHERCHANNEL CONFIGURATION METHOD'S :

	* PAGP (Port Aggregation Protocol)
		-> cisco proprietary protocol
		-> Dynamically negotiates the creation/maintenance of the etherchannel
		-> Similar to DTP
	
	* LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)
		-> Industry Standard Protocol (IEEE 802.3ad)
		-> Dynamically negotiates the creation/maintenance of the etherchannel
		-> Similar to DTP

	* Static etherchannel
		-> A protocol isnt used to determine if an etherchannel should be formed
		-> staticaly configured to form an etherchannel
			-> this method is never used <-

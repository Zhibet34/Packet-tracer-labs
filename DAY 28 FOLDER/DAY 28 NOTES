OSPF Network Types :

	--> Refers to the type of connection between OSPF neighbors (Ethernet, etc )

	- 3 types of OSPF network types :
	
		# Broadcast 
		
			- enabled by default on < Ethernet > and < FDDI> interfaces

				+ FDDI --> Fiber Distributed Data Interface
		
		# Point-To-Point

			- enabled by default on < PPP > and < HDLC > interfaces

				+ PPP --> Point To Point 

				+ HDLC --> High-Level Data Link Control

		# Non-broadcast 

			- enabled by default on < Frame Relay > and < X.25 > interfaces


	- OSPF Broadcast Network type
	
		- Enabled by default on ethernet and fiber

		- Routers dynamically discover neighbors by sending/ listening to Hello messages 
		  using multicast address 224.0.0.5

		- A DR (Designated Router) and BDR (Backup Designated Router) must be elected on
		  each subnet

			--> If theres no OSPF neighbors than only DR is elected

		- Routers which arent DR or BDR become a DROther

		- The DR / BDR election order of priority

			1. Highest OSPF interface priority

			2. Highest OSPF Router ID

			- 'First Place' becomes the DR for the subnet, 'Second Place' becomes 				   the BDR

				---> The default OSPF interface priority is 1 on all interfaces

			- Once the DR / BDR are selected they will keep their role until OSPF is reset

				* onces the DR goes down , the BDR becomes the new DR

					--> Then an election is held for the next BDR

				* DROthers will move to the Full State with the DR and BDR.

					--> The neighbor state with other DROthers will be 2 ways
			
			- In the broadcast network type, routers will only form a full adjacency with DR and
		
			  BDR of the segment

				# As a result :

					1. Routers only exchange LSA with the DR and BDR

					2. DROthers will not exchange LSAs with each other

				# All routers will still have the same LSDB , but this reduces the amount of 

				  LSAs flooding the network

	- OSPF Point-To-Point Network Type

		- Enabled on serial interfaces using the PPP or HDLC encapsulations by default

		- Routers discover neighbors by sending / listening for OSPF Hello messages using the
		  multicast address 224.0.0.5

		- DR / BDR are not elected

		- Two routers will form a Full adjacency with each other

			# One side of a serial connection functions as DCE ( Data Communications Equipment )

				* This side needs to specify the clock rate (speed) of the connection

			# The other side functions as DTE ( Data Terminal Equipment )

				--> Etherchannel uses the speed command to configure operating speed of the 				    interface

				--> Serial interfaces uses the clock rate command

		- Default encapsulation on a serial interface is HDLC ( CHDLC --> Cisco HDLC)

			# If encapsulation changes , the change must match on both sides or the Interface 			  will go down

	- OSPF Neighbor Requirements
		
		1. Area number must match

		2. Interfaces must be in the same subnet

		3. OSPF process must not be shutdown
		
		4. OSPF Router IDs must be unique

		5. Hello and Dead timers must match

		6. Authencation settings must match
		
		7. IP MTU settings must match

			--> can become OSPF neighbors, but OSPF doesnt operate properly

			--> MTU : Maximum Transmission Unit

		8. OSPF Network Type must match
		
			--> can become OSPF neighbors, but OSPF doesnt operate properly


OSPF LSA TYPES : 
	
	- 3 Types of LSAs

		* Type 1 --> Router LSA

		* Type 2 --> Network LSA

		* Type 5 --> AS External LSA

	# Type 1 Router LSA

		- Every OSPF router generates this type of LSA
	
		- It identifies the router using its Router ID

		- Lists networks attached to the router's OSPF-activated interfaces

	# Type 2 Network LSA

		- Generated by the DR of each 'multi-access' network
		
			* Broadcast Network Type

		- Lists the routers which are attached to the multi-access network

	# Type 5 As-External LSA

		- Generated by ASBRs to describe routers to destinations outside of the AS (OSPF domain)
